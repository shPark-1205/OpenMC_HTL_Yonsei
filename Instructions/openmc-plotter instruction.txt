Executing openmc-plotter in a Linux Container via Docker


This guide details the steps to launch the openmc-plotter graphical utility within your Docker Linux container, assuming you have already set up your OpenMC image and the VcXsrv X-server on Windows.

Standard Procedure (Using VcXsrv)
	○ Open Command Prompt (CMD).
	○ Verify Docker Images: List your available Docker images to get the correct name or ID.
	    - docker images
	○ Run Container with Graphics and Volume Mapping: Start the container, map the display for graphical output, and link your local work folder to the container's /opt/ directory.
	    - docker run -it --name [your_container_name] -e "DISPLAY=host.docker.internal:0" -v "[your_local_work_folder_path]:/opt/" [image_name] bash
	    Example: docker run -it --name openmc_container_v1.0 -e "DISPLAY=host.docker.internal:0" -v "D:/HTL/03.PersonalResearch/OpenMC:/opt/" openmc_psh_v5.5 bash
	○ Enter Container Environment: Confirm the CMD prompt has changed to reflect the container's root environment (e.g., root@~~~:/#).
	○ Check Root Directory:
	    - ls (Verify that the opt folder is present.)
	○ Navigate to Work Folder:
	    - cd opt
	○ Check Mapped Folder:
	    - ls (Verify that your local files and folders are visible.)
	○ Execute openmc-plotter: Launch the graphical utility. The window should appear on your Windows desktop.
	    - openmc-plotter


Troubleshooting Graphics Issues (Using MobaXterm)

If you encounter issues with VcXsrv (e.g., resizing problems, unresponsive buttons in openmc-plotter):
	○ Install MobaXterm: Download and install MobaXterm.
	○ Launch and Minimize MobaXterm: Run MobaXterm, and keep the main application window open (you can minimize it, but it must be running). MobaXterm includes its own superior X-server.
	○ Re-run the process.
	○ Docker will automatically use MobaXterm's running X-server for the display, which should resolve the graphical bugs.
